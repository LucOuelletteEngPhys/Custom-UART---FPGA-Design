# Custom-UART
Custom UART Receiver and Transmitter modules

## Overview
UART receiver and transmitter modules designed for ASCII character 
encodings. The receiver is split into datapath and FSM controller modules, while the 
transmitter has datapath and FSM controller integrated into one module. This is a 
successful attempt at UART receiver/transmitter modules, which could be further 
refactored with expanded capability. The design was successfully implemented on hardware 
and communicated with a host computer using TeraTerm.
